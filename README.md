# R Markdown: A Modest Guide


**Note to Students**: This guide is available on [my website](http://ryansafner.com/tutorial/RMDG.html), which Blackboard will link to. The source files are also available [on GitHub](http://github.com/ryansafner/RMDG)

**Note to Everyone Else**: This guide is oriented primarily for my [Econometrics class](http://ryansafner.com/courses/econ480) at Hood College, but should be of wider use to anyone interested in learning `R` for data analysis. Lecture slides, handouts, and guides (both PDFs and source code in R Markdown) are openly available [on GitHub](http://github.com/ryansafner/ECON480/).

**See also my companion guide to using R** hosted on [my website](http://ryansafner.com/tutorial/R4EH.html), with source available also [on GitHub](http://github.com/ryansafner/R4EH)
